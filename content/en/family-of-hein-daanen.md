Hein Daanen is married to Elly Rentes and has 2 children.

As a hobby Hein started to make an inventory of the family members, helped by several others. Now a database is constructed of over 2000 family members.\
The Daanen family comes from Beuningen in the province of Gelderland.\
The mother of Hein is Joke **Savelkouls**. Thanks to *Frans Savelkouls* in Oisterwijk, almost 1000 family members of the Savelkouls family are to my disposal. The roots are in Limburg, in the South of The Netherlands.\
The father of Elly, *Henk Rentes*, took care for the data of the **Rentes** family, originating from Friesland in Northern Netherlands.\
The family of the mother of Elly, Bep **Maat** is also available in detail, thanks to *Betty Maat*. The Maat family and the family Van der Plas (grandma of Elly) originate from Katwijk a/d Zee, a fishermans town at the West coast.  

Additional data on the Daanen family are greatly appreciated. Please contact [Hein Daanen](mailto:daanen@ziggo.nl) for any additional information.
