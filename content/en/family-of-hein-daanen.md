Hein Daanen is married to Elly Rentes and has 2 children.

As a hobby Hein started to make an inventory of the family members, helped by several others. Now a database is constructed of over 2000 family members.  
The Daanen family is available on this website: [daanen.pdf](https://heindaanen.nl/images/daanen.pdf "daanen.pdf"). _Andr√© van Eck_ is acknowledged for his contribution. The Daanen family comes from Beuningen in the province of Gelderland.  
The mother of Hein is Joke **Savelkouls**. Thanks to _Frans Savelkouls_ in Oisterwijk, almost 1000 family members of the Savelkouls family are to my disposal. The roots are in Limburg, in the South of The Netherlands.  
The father of Elly, _Henk Rentes_, took care for the data of the **Rentes** family, originating from Friesland in Northern Netherlands.  
The family of the mother of Elly, Bep **Maat** is also available in detail, thanks to _Betty Maat_. The Maat family and the family Van der Plas (grandma of Elly) originate from Katwijk a/d Zee, a fishermans town at the West coast.
